\title{Sativsky-Golay filtering of spectra}
\usage{
filter_sg(spectra, n = 11, p = 2, m = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{matrix where each row is a spectrum and each column is a separate wavelength. It is important that these wavelengths be at least very nearly evenly spaced.}

\item{n, p, m}{parameters controlling \code{\link{sgolayfilt}} window size, polynomial order and derivative order respectively.}
}
\description{
This function performs a Sativsky Golay filter using \code{\link{sgolayfilt}} on matrices in which each row is a separate spectrum.
}
\note{
This function will be deprecated in the next version, please use \code{\link{filter_spectra}} instead
